# 0x00-python-hello_world

Welcome to the 0x00-python-hello_world directory within the ALX Higher Level Programming repository. This directory contains a series of Shell scripts and Python files that cover various introductory concepts in Python programming.

## Introduction

The `0x00-python-hello_world` directory serves as an introduction to the Python programming language. It covers a range of topics, including writing and executing Python scripts, working with strings, variables, basic input/output, and exploring fundamental programming concepts.

## Directory Contents

1. [0-run](./0-run): A Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name is stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

2. [1-run_inline](./1-run_inline): A Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code is stored in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

3. [2-print.py](./2-print.py): A Python script that prints the string "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

4. [3-print_number.py](./3-print_number.py): A Python script that prints a number stored in the variable `number`, followed by the string "Battery street" and a new line.

5. [4-print_float.py](./4-print_float.py): A Python script that prints a floating-point number stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

6. [5-print_string.py](./5-print_string.py): A Python script that prints a specific string multiple times and displays its first 9 characters.

7. [6-concat.py](./6-concat.py): A Python script that concatenates two strings and prints the result.

8. [7-edges.py](./7-edges.py): A Python script that manipulates a string and prints its substrings.

9. [8-concat_edges.py](./8-concat_edges.py): A Python script that creates a new string by combining substrings.

10. [9-easter_egg.py](./9-easter_egg.py): A Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

11. [10-check_cycle.c](./10-check_cycle.c): A C function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

12. [lists.h](./lists.h): Header file containing the data structure definition for linked lists.

## Usage

To use the scripts and files in this directory:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Navigate to the `0x00-python-hello_world` directory.

3. Explore each subdirectory and Python script for specific instructions and details about each task.

4. Run the scripts using appropriate commands provided in each task's description.

## Technical Interview Preparation

For technical interview preparation, the directory includes the file `10-check_cycle.c` that demonstrates how to check for a cycle in a singly linked list using C.

Please note that this task is designed for educational and interview preparation purposes, focusing on efficient solutions and memory considerations.
