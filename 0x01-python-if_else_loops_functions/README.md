## Introduction
In this module, we will delve into the core building blocks of Python programming. You will learn how to make decisions using conditional statements, repeat actions using loops, and encapsulate reusable code using functions.

## Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Learn about the if, elif, and else statements, and how to make logical decisions in your programs.

## Loops
Loops enable you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. Explore the for and while loops, and discover how to iterate over sequences, ranges, and perform iterative tasks efficiently.

## Functions
Functions are essential for organizing and reusing code. Dive into defining, calling, and returning values from functions. Understand function parameters, arguments, and how to create modular, maintainable code.

## Projects
0-positive_or_negative.py
1-last_digit.py
2-print_alphabet.py
3-print_alphabt.py
4-print_hexa.py
5-print_comb2.py
6-print_comb3.py
7-islower.py
8-uppercase.py
9-print_last_digit.py
0-positive_or_negative.py
This script assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. It then prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

`1-last_digit.py`
This script assigns a random number to the variable number and prints the last digit of the number along with additional information, such as whether the last digit is greater than 5, equal to 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

`2-print_alphabet.py`
This program prints the entire ASCII alphabet in lowercase, without new lines. It uses a loop and a single print function with string formatting.

`3-print_alphabt.py`
Similar to the previous script, this program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'. It achieves this by using a loop and a single print function.

`4-print_hexa.py`
This script prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats. It utilizes a loop and a single print function with string formatting to achieve the desired output.

`5-print_comb2.py`
This script prints all numbers from 0 to 99 in ascending order, separated by commas and a space. It uses a loop and a limited number of print functions with string formatting.

`6-print_comb3.py`
This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits, excluding repeated combinations. The digits are printed in ascending order, and the script uses nested loops and limited print functions.

`7-islower.py`
This script defines a function islower(c) that checks if a given character is lowercase. It returns True if the character is lowercase and False otherwise. The script demonstrates the use of the ord() function to compare ASCII values.

`8-uppercase.py`
This script defines a function uppercase(str) that converts a string to uppercase and prints it, followed by a new line. It showcases the use of the ord() function to convert characters to uppercase.

`9-print_last_digit.py`
This script defines a function print_last_digit(number) that prints the last digit of a given number. It returns the value of the last digit. The script does not use any imports and demonstrates the concept of modular arithmetic.

Feel free to explore each script for more details and run them to observe their output. These exercises provide hands-on experience with if-else statements, loops, string formatting, and function definitions in Python.
